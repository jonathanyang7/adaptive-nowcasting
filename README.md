## Reflection

This project, completed for my Big Data Analytics module at Warwick Business School, received a top-of-the-class mark of 92%.

The main objective of the project was to formulate a research question that could be addressed through the application of my data science skills. This involved selecting relevant data, processing it for analysis, conducting statistical analysis, and generating visualizations to effectively communicate the results. The entire process, including the rationale, methodology, and findings, was documented in a comprehensive report of approximately 2,000 words (see Section 03: Report).

One of my key learnings from this project was the critical importance of clear and engaging communication, both in written and visual forms. I've since developed my story-telling skills as a strategy consultant.
