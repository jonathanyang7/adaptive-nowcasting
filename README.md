## Reflection

This was a project built for my Big Data Analytics module at Warwick Business School which received a mark of 92% (top of the class). 

The project goal was to propose a research question which I could answer by analysing widely available datasets with my data science skills. Namely, choosing a relevant data, processing it into a form that I could analyse, carrying out the statistical analysis, and producing relevant visualisations to illustrate your results. The results of my project were written up into a c.2k report.
